# SQL Project - SQL Query Collection

## Description
**SQL Query Collection** is a beginner-to-advanced level project that serves as a comprehensive repository of SQL queries. The goal of this project is to help users learn and practice Structured Query Language (SQL) through real-world examples and scenarios. It covers the core SQL concepts such as data retrieval, filtering, joins, aggregation, subqueries, views, stored procedures, and more. This project is ideal for students, beginners, or anyone looking to strengthen their SQL skills through hands-on qu...

## Features
- Collection of SQL queries from beginner to advanced level.
- Covers key SQL concepts: SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, JOIN, ORDER BY, etc.
- Includes advanced topics like subqueries, views, stored procedures, and triggers.
- Organized examples with comments and explanations.
- Useful for self-study, interviews, and exam preparation.

## Technologies Used
- SQL (Structured Query Language)
- PostgreSQL (main database used for testing queries)
- DBeaver (optional: open-source SQL GUI tool)
- Git & GitHub for version control and collaboration

## Installation

To get started with this project on your local system, follow these steps:

### 1. Install PostgreSQL

- Download and install PostgreSQL from the official website: https://www.postgresql.org/download/
- During installation, remember your username (default: `postgres`) and password.

### 2. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Renuka-cell/SQL_Project_1.git
cd sql-query-collection
```

### 3. Set Up a Database (Optional)

- Open **pgAdmin** or your terminal (psql) and create a new database to test your queries:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE sql_practice;
```

### 4. Run and Practice Queries

- Open the `.sql` files in any SQL editor or PostgreSQL client (like pgAdmin, DBeaver, or VS Code with SQL extension).
- Copy and run queries to understand their functionality.
- Modify the queries to try different filters, joins, or conditions and learn through experimentation.

## Usage

- Browse the folders/files like `1_Basics.sql`, `2_Joins.sql`, `3_Aggregates.sql`, etc.
- Each file contains categorized queries along with comments for explanation.
- Copy and paste queries into your SQL client or terminal to execute them.
- Modify the queries to try different filters, joins, or conditions and learn through experimentation.

## Database Schema

This project does not depend on a specific fixed schema. However, to practice the queries effectively, you can create your own sample tables or use sample datasets that you might already have in your PostgreSQL instance.

Some commonly used example tables could be:
- `students` (with fields like `student_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `dob`, etc.)
- `employees` (with fields like `employee_id`, `name`, `position`, `salary`, etc.)
- `orders` (with fields like `order_id`, `order_date`, `customer_id`, `amount`, etc.)

You can also use PostgreSQLâ€™s sample databases like:
- `dvdrental` (video rental store database)
- `employees` (HR data)

If you'd like to use these datasets, you can load them into your database for testing.

### Example Table: `students`
| student_id | first_name | last_name | dob        |
|------------|------------|-----------|------------|
| 1          | John       | Doe       | 2000-05-15 |
| 2          | Jane       | Smith     | 1999-07-23 |

### Example Table: `orders`
| order_id | order_date | customer_id | amount |
|----------|------------|-------------|--------|
| 101      | 2022-01-15 | 1           | 250    |
| 102      | 2022-02-20 | 2           | 150    |
